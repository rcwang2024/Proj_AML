Dear Dr. Hromas,

RE: Original Article Submission - "Molecular Subtypes in Adult Acute Myeloid
Leukemia Predict Venetoclax Response Independent of Genomic Alterations"

We submit for consideration in Blood our manuscript titled "Molecular Subtypes
in Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Predict Venetoclax Response Independent of
Genomic Alterations." This work represents a comprehensive multi-omics analysis
of 2,535 AML patients across three independent cohorts, establishing a paradigm
distinction between prognostic biomarkers (outcome prediction) and predictive
biomarkers (treatment selection) with immediate clinical implications for
precision medicine.

SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION

Our study makes three critical advances to the field:

First, we demonstrate that molecular subtypes derived from RNA-sequencing data
provide exceptional independent predictive value for drug response despite non-
independence for prognosis. This finding challenges the conventional assumption
that biomarkers must predict survival to have clinical utility. Specifically,
while our clusters do not provide independent prognostic value in multivariate
analysis controlling for TP53 and TET2 mutations (HR=1.06, p=0.649), they
demonstrate extraordinary independent predictive value for Venetoclax response
(+161% R² improvement beyond all genomic alterations, p=3.2×10⁻¹²) with
mechanistic validation through BCL-2 pathway gene expression. Among 155 drugs
tested, 72 (46.5%) showed significant differential response, with 19 of 20 top
drugs maintaining independent predictive value (mean +42% R² improvement, all
FDR<0.05).

Second, we provide mechanistic validation demonstrating that differential
Venetoclax sensitivity (p=2.78×10⁻²⁴, Cohen's d=1.25) is biologically grounded
in BCL-2 pathway expression patterns. Nine of ten BCL-2 family genes show
significant differential expression between clusters (all FDR<0.05), with BCL2
expression inversely correlated with Venetoclax AUC (ρ=-0.55, p<0.001). This
mechanistic insight explains why Cluster 1 patients demonstrate 1.79-fold
greater Venetoclax sensitivity compared to Cluster 2, providing biological
rationale for clinical translation.

Third, we transform Venetoclax-resistant Cluster 2 from a "poor prognosis"
group into a "targetable" population by identifying 26 alternative drugs with
preferential sensitivity, including 8 FDA-approved agents led by Panobinostat
(HDAC inhibitor, Cohen's d=0.92). Combined with a Venetoclax Response Score
clinical decision tool, this work provides an actionable framework for
treatment selection in adult AML.

WHY BLOOD

Blood is the ideal venue for this work for several reasons. First, the scope
and rigor of our study—2,535 patients, 3 independent cohorts, 5 phases of
validation including comprehensive robustness testing—align with Blood's
standards for high-impact molecular studies in hematologic malignancies.
Second, our work builds upon the BeatAML consortium data (Tyner et al., Nature
2018), representing the next translational step from discovery to clinical
implementation. Third, our finding that clusters predict treatment response
independent of mutations addresses a critical gap in AML precision medicine,
directly relevant to Blood's audience of clinicians and translational
researchers. Finally, the distinction between prognostic and predictive
biomarkers, with immediate implications for FDA-approved drug selection, fits
Blood's mission to publish clinically impactful science.

STUDY STRENGTHS

Our manuscript demonstrates several methodological strengths:

• Scale: 2,535 patients across 3 independent cohorts (BeatAML discovery n=671,
  TCGA-LAML validation n=151, TARGET-AML n=1,713)

• Rigor: Comprehensive validation including proportional hazards-free survival
  methods, multivariate analysis, meta-analysis, mechanistic validation, and
  robustness testing (bootstrap, LOOCV, permutation, sample-split)

• Honesty: Clear acknowledgment that clusters are NOT independent for prognosis
  (p=0.649) while emphasizing orthogonal predictive value for treatment—a
  critical distinction often overlooked in biomarker studies

• Multiple testing correction: Study-wide FDR correction applied to 13 primary
  tests, with all procedures documented in supplementary catalog

• Clinical actionability: FDA-approved drugs (Venetoclax, Panobinostat,
  Sorafenib), clinical decision tool (VRS tertile classification), and proposed
  Phase II trial design (CLUSTER-AML) provide clear translational pathway

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

We acknowledge that drug sensitivity was measured using ex vivo assays, which
may not fully recapitulate in vivo response due to microenvironment
interactions, pharmacokinetics, and patient-specific factors. While BeatAML ex
vivo data have demonstrated correlation with clinical outcomes in prior
validation studies, prospective clinical validation remains essential before
clinical implementation. We propose a Phase II trial design (CLUSTER-AML,
detailed in Supplementary Protocol) to address this limitation. Additionally,
the pediatric TARGET-AML cohort showed opposite effect direction (HR=0.81 vs
adult HR=1.35), restricting subtype applicability to adult AML and underscoring
the importance of age-stratified biomarker development.
