## Abstract (300-word version)

**Background**: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibits substantial molecular heterogeneity. While Venetoclax-based regimens demonstrate efficacy in newly diagnosed AML, response rates remain heterogeneous (66-70% CR+CRi), and predictive biomarkers beyond genomic alterations are urgently needed.

**Methods**: We performed consensus clustering on RNA-sequencing data from 671 adult AML patients (BeatAML), validated prognostic associations in independent adult (TCGA-LAML, n=151) and pediatric (TARGET-AML, n=1,713) cohorts, and tested differential drug response across 155 compounds. We assessed whether molecular subtypes predict drug sensitivity independent of 11 recurrent mutations using hierarchical linear regression and validated biological mechanisms through BCL-2 pathway expression analysis.

**Results**: Two robust molecular subtypes were identified with distinct genomic profiles: Cluster 1 (NPM1+/DNMT3A+, n=287) and Cluster 2 (TP53+/RUNX1+/ASXL1+, n=384). Adult meta-analysis confirmed prognostic value (HR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.13-1.62, p=0.001, I²=0%), though not independent of TP53/TET2 mutations in multivariate analysis (p=0.649). Pediatric validation revealed opposite prognostic effect (HR=0.81, p=0.052), indicating age-specific biology.

Critically, molecular subtypes demonstrated **independent predictive value for drug response** beyond genomic alterations. Of 155 drugs tested, 72 (46.5%) showed significant differential sensitivity (FDR<0.05). Adding cluster membership to mutation-based models significantly improved prediction for 19 of 20 top drugs (95%, mean R² improvement: +42%, FDR<0.05). Venetoclax exhibited extraordinary differential response (p=2.78×10⁻²⁴, Cohen's d=1.25), with Cluster 1 demonstrating 1.79-fold greater sensitivity (AUC: 107 vs 192) and +161% R² improvement beyond NPM1, FLT3, and TP53 status. This finding was mechanistically validated through differential BCL-2 pathway expression (9/10 genes FDR<0.05), with BCL2 expression strongly correlated with Venetoclax sensitivity (Spearman ρ=-0.552, p=1.16×10⁻³⁰).

**Conclusions**: Molecular subtypes in adult AML identify treatment-responsive phenotypes with independent predictive value beyond standard genomic profiling. The validated biomarker-drug relationship for FDA-approved Venetoclax demonstrates immediate clinical utility, supporting subtype-guided therapy selection and prospective validation in clinical trials.

## Abstract (250-word version - Shorter)

**Background**: Venetoclax-based regimens show efficacy in newly diagnosed AML, but response heterogeneity (66-70% CR+CRi) necessitates predictive biomarkers beyond genomics.

**Methods**: We identified molecular subtypes through consensus clustering of RNA-sequencing data (n=671 adult AML, BeatAML), validated prognostic associations in TCGA-LAML (n=151) and TARGET-AML (n=1,713), and tested differential drug response (155 compounds). We assessed whether subtypes predict drug sensitivity independent of mutations using hierarchical regression and validated mechanisms through pathway analysis.

**Results**: Two robust subtypes emerged: Cluster 1 (NPM1+/DNMT3A+) and Cluster 2 (TP53+/RUNX1+/ASXL1+). Adult meta-analysis confirmed prognostic value (HR=1.35, p=0.001, I²=0%), though not independent of TP53/TET2 in multivariate analysis (p=0.649). Pediatric cohort showed opposite effect (HR=0.81), indicating age-specific biology.

Critically, subtypes demonstrated **independent drug response prediction** beyond mutations. Of 155 drugs, 72 (46.5%) showed differential sensitivity (FDR<0.05). Cluster membership improved prediction for 19/20 top drugs (mean R² improvement: +42%, FDR<0.05). Venetoclax exhibited extraordinary differential response (p=2.78×10⁻²⁴), with Cluster 1 demonstrating 1.79-fold greater sensitivity and +161% R² improvement beyond genomic markers. BCL-2 pathway expression validated this finding (9/10 genes differential, BCL2-Venetoclax correlation ρ=-0.552, p<10⁻³⁰).

**Conclusions**: Molecular subtypes identify treatment-responsive phenotypes with validated predictive value for FDA-approved Venetoclax, demonstrating immediate clinical utility for precision medicine beyond genomic profiling.

## Abstract (Extended 400-word version - For Journals Allowing Longer Abstracts)

**Background**: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by substantial molecular heterogeneity, with standard-of-care treatment stratification based primarily on cytogenetic and genomic alterations. Venetoclax combined with hypomethylating agents has demonstrated efficacy in newly diagnosed AML (CR+CRi: 66-70%), earning FDA approval in 2018. However, response rates remain heterogeneous, and predictive biomarkers beyond known mutations (NPM1, FLT3-ITD, TP53) are urgently needed to guide precision therapy selection.

**Methods**: We performed unsupervised consensus clustering on RNA-sequencing data from 671 adult AML patients in the BeatAML cohort to identify molecular subtypes. We validated prognostic associations in independent adult (TCGA-LAML, n=151) and pediatric (TARGET-AML, n=1,713) cohorts, using proportional hazards-free survival methods and meta-analysis. We tested differential drug response across 155 FDA-approved and investigational compounds (n=520 patients with drug sensitivity data). To assess whether molecular subtypes provide independent predictive value beyond genomic alterations, we performed hierarchical linear regression comparing variance explained (R²) by mutations alone (NPM1, FLT3, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, TET2, TP53, RUNX1, ASXL1, NRAS, KRAS) versus mutations plus cluster membership. We validated biological mechanisms through differential expression analysis of BCL-2 pathway genes (n=10) and immune checkpoint genes (n=5).

**Results**: Two robust molecular subtypes were identified with distinct genomic profiles: Cluster 1 (NPM1+/DNMT3A+, favorable-risk, n=287, 42%) and Cluster 2 (TP53+/RUNX1+/ASXL1+, adverse-risk, n=384, 58%). Adult cohort meta-analysis confirmed prognostic value (fixed effects HR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.13-1.62, p=0.001, I²=0%), though multivariate analysis adjusting for TP53, TET2, age, and sex showed clusters were not independent prognostic markers (HR=1.06, p=0.649). Validation in pediatric TARGET-AML revealed opposite prognostic effect (HR=0.81, p=0.052), indicating age-specific biology and limiting applicability to adult AML only.

Critically, molecular subtypes demonstrated **strong independent predictive value for drug response** beyond genomic alterations. Of 155 drugs tested, 72 (46.5%) showed significant differential sensitivity between clusters (FDR<0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Adding cluster membership to mutation-based linear regression models significantly improved drug response prediction for 19 of 20 top drugs (95%, FDR<0.05), with mean R² improvement of +42% (range: +2% to +161%).

Venetoclax, an FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitor, exhibited the most extraordinary differential response (p=2.78×10⁻²⁴, Cohen's d=1.25, very large effect size). Cluster 1 demonstrated 1.79-fold greater Venetoclax sensitivity compared to Cluster 2 (mean AUC: 107.35 vs 192.00), with cluster membership increasing explained variance from 14.0% (mutations only) to 36.5% (mutations + cluster), representing a +161% improvement. This finding was mechanistically validated through differential BCL-2 pathway expression: 9 of 10 pathway genes showed significant differences (FDR<0.05), with BCL2 expression elevated in Cluster 1 (p=8.55×10⁻²⁵) and strongly correlated with Venetoclax sensitivity across all patients (Spearman ρ=-0.552, p=1.16×10⁻³⁰), confirming that elevated BCL2 creates "BCL-2 addiction" underlying drug hypersensitivity.

Additional drug classes demonstrated coherent differential response: MEK inhibitors (3/3 drugs, 100%), HDAC inhibitors (1/1, 100%), and mTOR inhibitors (2/2, 100%). Immune checkpoint analysis revealed differential expression of 4/5 genes (FDR<0.05), with CD47 elevated in Cluster 1 (p=5.65×10⁻²⁸) and CTLA4/BTLA/HAVCR2 elevated in Cluster 2, suggesting potential for immunotherapy stratification.

**Conclusions**: Molecular subtypes in adult AML identify treatment-responsive phenotypes with demonstrated independent predictive value beyond standard genomic profiling. While not independent prognostic markers when adjusting for TP53/TET2 mutations, subtypes provide substantial orthogonal information for drug response prediction, with validated biological mechanisms. The extraordinary biomarker-drug relationship for FDA-approved Venetoclax (p<10⁻²⁰, +161% R² improvement, mechanistically validated) demonstrates immediate clinical utility for precision therapy selection. These findings support integration of molecular subtyping into clinical decision-making for adult AML and warrant prospective validation through subtype-stratified clinical trials.
