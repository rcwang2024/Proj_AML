[Additional authors as needed]

All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.


OPTION 2: NARRATIVE FORMAT (Alternative)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Author 1] designed the study, performed all data analyses, created figures,
and wrote the original manuscript draft. [Author 2] supervised the project,
obtained funding, and provided critical manuscript revisions. [Author 3] and
[Author 4] contributed to data curation and provided input on methodology.
[Author 5] advised on statistical methods and validated results. All authors
reviewed and approved the final manuscript.


OPTION 3: DETAILED WITH SPECIFICS (Most Informative)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Author 1 - First Author]: Conceptualization of the predictive vs prognostic
biomarker framework; data curation for all three cohorts (BeatAML, TCGA,
TARGET); formal analysis including consensus clustering, survival analysis,
drug response analysis, and multivariate modeling; methodology development for
cluster independence testing; software development for all R analysis scripts;
validation across multiple robustness methods; visualization of all main and
supplementary figures; writing of original manuscript draft; writing review
and editing of all revisions.

[Author 2 - Senior/Corresponding Author]: Conceptualization of study goals and
translational implications; funding acquisition for computational resources and
personnel; project administration and oversight; resources including BeatAML
data access; supervision of all research activities; critical review and
editing of manuscript with focus on clinical translation sections.

[Author 3 - Bioinformatics Collaborator]: Data curation for RNA-sequencing
data processing and quality control; formal analysis of gene expression
patterns; methodology for batch correction and normalization; validation of
50-gene classifier performance; review and editing of methods section.

[Author 4 - Clinical Collaborator]: Conceptualization of clinical trial design
(CLUSTER-AML); resources including clinical interpretation of drug response
patterns; investigation of mechanism through BCL-2 pathway analysis; review
and editing of discussion section with emphasis on clinical implications.

[Author 5 - Biostatistician]: Formal analysis advice on survival methods and
multiple testing correction; methodology for proportional hazards-free
approaches; validation of statistical procedures; review and editing of
statistical methods section and results interpretation.

All authors critically reviewed the manuscript, approved the final version,
and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.

FORMATTING NOTES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Blood journal typically uses Option 1 (detailed CRediT format)

2. List authors in order matching manuscript byline

3. Use full names (not initials) for author contributions section

4. Separate multiple roles with commas

5. End with statement: "All authors have read and approved the final
   manuscript." (REQUIRED)

6. If authors are from BeatAML consortium or other large collaborations,
   add note: "The BeatAML Study Group authors contributed to data
   generation, quality control, and provided critical review of the
   manuscript."

7. For Blood submission, this goes in a separate "Author Contributions"
   section at the end of the manuscript (after Discussion, before References)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT (Include in same section)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TEMPLATE:
