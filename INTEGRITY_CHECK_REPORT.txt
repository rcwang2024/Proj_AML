Date: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S

## OVERALL STATUS: ALL ANALYSES VERIFIED AND COMPLETE

All phases of the analysis have been successfully executed with correct outputs.

## Phase-by-Phase Verification:

✓ Phase 1 (Batch Correction): PASS
  - Batch-corrected expression: 22,843 genes × 707 samples
  - Batch effects successfully removed (p>0.2)
  - Figures generated: PCA before/after

✓ Phase 2.1 (Consensus Clustering): PASS
  - Sample assignments: 707 samples classified
  - Cluster distribution: 320 (45.3%) vs 387 (54.7%)
  - Consensus score: 0.797 (high reproducibility)
  - Optimal k=2 confirmed

✓ Phase 2.2 (Pathway Enrichment): PASS
  - Pathways analyzed: 50 Hallmark gene sets
  - Clear biological distinction between subtypes
  - Proliferative vs Immune-Inflammatory patterns

✓ Phase 2.3 (Subtype Characterization): PASS
  - Differential expression: 1,509 significant genes
  - Clinical associations: Sex difference (p=0.010)
  - Mutation enrichment tested

✓ Phase 3 (Survival Analysis): PASS
  - Median survival: 19.1 vs 11.8 months
  - Log-rank test: p=0.00155 (highly significant)
  - Cox regression: HR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.13-1.68

✓ Phase 4 (Drug Response): PASS
  - Drugs tested: 155 compounds
  - Significant associations: 82 drugs (FDR<0.10)
  - Top drug: Venetoclax (p<10⁻²²)

✓ Data Consistency: PASS
  - All files present and accessible
  - Sample IDs consistent across phases
  - All 8 figures generated successfully

## Summary:
- Total result files: 60+ files verified
