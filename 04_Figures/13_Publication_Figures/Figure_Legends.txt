Figure 1. Study Overview and Molecular Subtype Discovery.
(A) Sample overlap across four data types (expression, mutations, drug response, clinical).
(B) Principal component analysis of gene expression data after batch correction, colored by molecular subtype.
(C) Consensus clustering matrix showing robustness of k=2 solution across 1000 bootstrap iterations.
(D) Distribution of samples across two molecular subtypes (Proliferative n=320, Immune-Inflammatory n=387).

Figure 2. Molecular Characterization of AML Subtypes.
(A) Heatmap of pathway activity scores showing distinct biological profiles. Proliferative subtype enriched for cell cycle and DNA repair pathways; Immune-Inflammatory subtype enriched for immune response and cytokine signaling.
(B) Mutation frequencies of 23 key AML genes by molecular subtype. Proliferative subtype enriched for NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, IDH1; Immune-Inflammatory subtype enriched for TP53, RUNX1, ASXL1, RAS pathway mutations.
(C) Distribution of ELN 2017 risk categories by molecular subtype, showing significant association (Chi-square p<10⁻⁹).

Figure 3. Clinical Outcomes and Therapeutic Implications.
(A) Kaplan-Meier survival curves showing significant overall survival difference between molecular subtypes (log-rank p=0.00155). Median survival: Proliferative 19.1 months, Immune-Inflammatory 11.8 months.
(B) Forest plot of multivariate Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and ELN risk.
(C) Venetoclax sensitivity by molecular subtype. Proliferative subtype shows dramatically higher sensitivity (p=2.78×10⁻²⁴, Cohen's d=-1.25).

Figure 4. Comprehensive Drug Response Profiling.
(A) Heatmap showing differential drug sensitivity across 82 drugs with FDR<0.10. Rows represent drugs, columns represent samples ordered by molecular subtype. Color indicates area under curve (AUC) with lower values representing higher sensitivity.

Supplementary Figure 1. Batch Effect Correction.
(A) PCA before batch correction showing clustering by technical covariates (sequencing wave, center).
(B) PCA after ComBat batch correction showing removal of technical variation while preserving biological signal.

FigureS2
Supplementary Figure 2. Cox Proportional Hazards Model Diagnostics.
(A) Schoenfeld residuals for testing proportional hazards assumption. Cluster and age variables show violations (p<0.05), suggesting time-varying effects.
(B) DFBETA plots showing one influential observation (sample 670) with high leverage on cluster coefficient.

FigureS3
Supplementary Figure 3. Molecular Subtypes and ELN Risk Classification.
(A) Overall survival stratified by combined ELN risk and molecular subtype (p=1.38×10⁻¹⁴). Molecular subtypes provide additional prognostic value specifically within ELN Adverse category (p=0.0049).
